The Tween Module for [Adventure Game Studio (AGS)](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/)
can be used to script ["inbetweening"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening). The module allows you to control many properties in GUIs, GUI controls, room objects, characters, audio, System, etc.
It allows these inbetweens to be blocking, non blocking, or to loop them, and it features
acceleration/deceleration easing functions.

The current module is compatible with AGS 3.0 and above. 1.x modules are also compatible with AGS 2.72.
