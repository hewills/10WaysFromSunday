# Writing your First Tween

Tweens are supported in all kinds of objects:

* Characters
* GUI
* GUI Controls
* Room Objects
* Audio
* Regions
* Viewport
* etc.

Many of each object's properties have a tween function. These properties include position, scaling,
transparency, size, etc.

To start, let's tween a GUI!

## Example

We're going to tween the `gIconbar` GUI that comes with an AGS default game. You can tween the GUI's Y coordinate by using the `TweenY` function.

The first parameter is the **Timing**, in this case measured in seconds, and the second parameter is the Y target:

    gIconbar.TweenY(0.5, -gIconbar.Height);

In half a second, the GUI will move from its current Y coordinate to minus its heights, placing the GUI vertically off the screen.

This is one the most basic Tweens that you can create. This will result in a very boring linear movement from start to end,
but you can make it more exciting by adding an optional **Easing Type**:

    gIconbar.TweenY(0.5, -gIconbar.Height, eEaseInBackTween);

This will move the GUI up as before, but this time around it will use an Ease In of type "Back".
This will first move the GUI down a bit (it goes *back* first), then move it up towards its final Y coordinate.
The back part happens in the beginning because it's an ease **In**.

There are also options to ease **Out**, or to both ease In and ease Out. You can visually see what all the
Easing types will do at [easings.net](http://easings.net).

By default, GUI Tweens are *Blocking*. If you would like to do a non-blocking Tween,
then you can control this with the next optional parameter, the **Style**:

    gIconbar.TweenY(0.5, -gIconbar.Height, eEaseInBackTween, eNoBlockTween);

Other Styles include blocking, repeat, and reverse repeat (goes in one direction first, then goes back, then it repeats).

The next optional parameter is the **Start Delay**. This allows you to start the Tween a few seconds later
instead of immediately:

    gIconbar.TweenY(0.5, -gIconbar.Height, eEaseInBackTween, eNoBlockTween, 1.0);

This will wait 1 second, then start the Tween. The tween will complete at 1.5 seconds
(0.5 duration + 1.0 delay) from the time this function was called in the script.

The last optional parameter is the **Timing Type**. By default, all Tweens are
set to be timed in seconds, but you can also set it to *speed*, which can roughly measured as pixels/second:

    gIconbar.TweenY(
      100.0,
      -gIconbar.Height,
      eEaseInBackTween,
      eNoBlockTween,
      1.0,
      eTweenSpeed
    );

This will start the same tween as before, but instead of lasting half a second regardless of where the GUI is located,
it is based on how long it takes the GUI to move from its current Y coordinate to off screen at a speed of 100 pixels per second.

Finally, you can immediately **Stop** all position Tweens affecting the `gIconbar`:

    gIconbar.StopTweenPosition();

By default, it will stop the GUI wherever it is located. You can optionally determine the
**Result** of how the Tween is stopped:

    gIconbar.StopTweenPosition(eFinishTween);

This will set the GUI's Y coordinate to the end of the Tween immediately. You can also use `eResetTween`, which
will reset the GUI's Y coordinate back to the start of the Tween.

## Note about leaving a Room

When the player leaves a room in the game, most tweens will be automatically stopped. This is because references such as room objects, hotspots, or characters may be lost. However, the module will try to keep other tweens playing such as GUI or Audio.

This can also be changed via the [Settings](scripting/settings.md) so that all tweens are stopped upon leaving the rooms.

## Recap

You can create Tweens that are very simple or fairly complex. The parameters you can add to any tween function include:

1. Timing (seconds or speed depending on what Timing is)
2. End Location (this could be more than one parameter depending on the tween)
3. Easing Type (optional)
4. Style (optional: Blocking, No Blocking, Repeat, and Reverse Repeat)
5. Start Delay (optional, in seconds only)
6. Timing Type (optional: to determine if the timing is in seconds or speed)

You can stop all the Tweens applied to an object using a `StopTween*` function. You can stop it
in at its current location, set it to the end of the Tween, or reset it back to the start of the Tween.
